# Getting Started
## What is a CustomInstanceStore?

CustomInstanceStore is an abstraction over InstanceStore that makes it easy to create persistence providers for Windows Workflow Foundation.

See the [parent GitHub project](https://github.com/mattmeisinger/custom-instance-store) for further details about the CustomInstanceStore abstraction.


## Installation

[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CustomInstanceStore.Neo4j)

	package-install CustomInstanceStore.Neo4j


## What versions of WF does this support?

It should work on both 4.0 and 4.5 versions of Workflow Foundation.


## Is there a demo application?

Check out the [GraphDocs project](https://github.com/mattmeisinger/graph-docs). Please note that it requires Neo4j to be running locally.
